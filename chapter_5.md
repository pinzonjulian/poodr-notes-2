# Chapter 5: Reducing Costs with Duck typing
if it quacks like a ðŸ¦†...

# 5.1 Understanding duck typing

> In Ruby [the] expectations about the behavior of an object come in the form of beliefs about its public interface.

> Users of an object need not, and **should not** be concerned about its class.

> It's not what an object is that matters. It's what it does.

### 5.1.1 Overlooking the Duck
See graphic in the book

### 5.1.2 Compounding the problem

> Concrete code is easy to understand but costly to extend. Abstract code may initially seem more obscure but, once understood, is far easier to change.

> The ability to tolerate ambiguity about the class of an object is the hallmark of a confident designer. Once you begin to treat your objects as if they are defined by their behavior rather than by their class, you enter into a new realm of expressive flexible design.

> ðŸ’¡ This means that it's actually a skill you can learn. That tolerance to abstract interfaces.

## 5.2 Writing code that relies on ducks

### 5.2.1 Recognizing hidden ducks

You have a hidden duck if you can spot:
- Case statements that switch on a `class`
- `kind_of?` and `is_a?`
- `responds_to?`

#### Case statements that switch on a `class`

```ruby
class Trip
  def prepare(preparers)
    preparers.each { |preparer|
      case preparer
      when Mechanic
        preparer.prepare_bicycles(bicycles)
      when TripCoordinator
        preparer.buy_food(customers)
      when Driver
        preparer.gas_up(vehicle)
        preparer.fill_water_tank(vehicle)
      end
    }
  end
  # ...
end
```

In the previous examples all prepared classes (`Mechanic`,`TripCoordinator`,`Driver`) "must share something in common".
> ... ask yourself: "What is it that prepare wants from each of its arguments?" The answer to that question suggests the message you shoul send; this message begins to define the underlying duck type.

#### `kind_of?` and `is_a?`
_"I know who you are, and because of that, I know what you do"_ This is actually a problem!

```ruby
if preparer.kind_of?(Mechanic)
  preparer.prepare_bicycles  (bicycles)
elsif preparer.kind_of?(TripCoordinator)
  preparer.buy_food  (customers)
elsif preparer.kind_of?(Driver)
  preparer.gas_up(vehicle)
  preparer.fill_water_tank(vehicle)
end
```

Same techniques as above apply to this.

#### `responds_to?`
_"I know who you are, and because of that, I know what you do"_ This is actually a problem!

```ruby
if preparer.respond_to?(:prepare_bicycles)
  preparer.prepare_bicycles(bicycles)
elsif preparer.respond_to?(:buy_food)
  preparer.buy_food(customers)
elsif preparer.respond_to?(:gas_up)
  preparer.gas_up(vehicle)
  preparer.fill_water_tank(vehicle)
end
```

This if statement cuts the dependency on the class names but now depends on the `Trip` class to know about the names of the methods of multiple preparers.
> ðŸš¨ To me this is even more obscure!

### 5.2.2 Placing trust in your ducks
_"I know who you are, and because of that, I know what you do"_

Knowing the "who" means you don't trust the object. Duck typing is all about trusting the object!

> Flexible applications are built on objects that operate on trust; it is your job to make your objects trustworthy

### 5.2.3 Documenting Duck Types
> The simplest kind of duck type is one that exists merely as an agreement about its public interface. This chapterâ€™s example code implements that kind of duck, where several different classes implement prepare_trip and can thus be treated like Preparers.

This is interesting because Sandi talks about `Preparers` without there being anything in the code that signals that someone is a `Preparer` other than the fact that they have an instance method called `prepare_trip`.

TL;DR document & test your duck's public interfaces. See chapter 9

### 5.2.4 Sharing code between Ducks
See chapter 7

### 5.2.5 Choosing your ducks wisely
> From this example, you can see that the decision to create a new duck type relies on judgment. [...] If creating a duck type would reduce unstable dependencies, do so. Use your best judgment.

## 5.3 Conquering a Fear of Duck Typing
### 5.3.1 Subverting Duck Types with Static Typing
### 5.3.2 Static versus Dynamic Typing
### 5.3.3 Embracing Dynamic Typing


> If your problem needs static typing, pick a language that enforces it; donâ€™t try to add static typing to Ruby. Attempting to write statically typed code in a dynamically typed language yields code that suffers from the worst of both worlds. Duck typing is built on dynamic typing; to reap the full benefit from duck typing, you must embrace this dynamism.
